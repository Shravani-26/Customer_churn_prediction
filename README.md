# Customer_churn_prediction

This project aims to predict whether customers will churn based on their behavioral and demographic data. The analysis helps businesses retain customers by identifying risk factors. Key highlights include:


EDA and Feature Engineering: Explored patterns in customer behavior and created new features to improve model performance.


Preprocessing: Managed imbalanced data using techniques like SMOTE and standardized the dataset.


Modeling Techniques: Implemented and compared models such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks.


Insights and Deployment: Provided actionable insights and prepared the model for deployment, emphasizing explainability with SHAP values.
